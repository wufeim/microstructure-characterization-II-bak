# Microstructure Characterization II

This is the repository for microstructure characterization research II since May 2019. It is composed of two parts:

- Feature engineering for image classification
- Representation learning with GANs

## Publication

This repo contains code for reproducing key results in [Image driven machine learning based microstructure recognition and quantification on small datasets](#).

Our previous work: [An image-driven machine learning approach to kinetic modeling of a discontinuous precipitation reaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.05496).

## Feature Engineering for Image Classification

### Resources

### Train a Classification Model

### Visualization of Training Outputs

#### Plot the confusion matrix for binary classification

Before this step, make sure you have trained a binary classification model and have the confusion matrix results ready.

To plot the confusion matrix, run

```shell script
python3 plot/confusion_matrix.py
```

The output figure will be saved to the ```./figures``` directory.

## Representation Learning with GANs

### Resources

### System requirements
