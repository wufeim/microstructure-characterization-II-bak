# Microstructure Characterization II

This is the repository for microstructure characterization research II since May 2019. It is composed of two parts:

- Feature engineering for image classification
- Representation learning with GANs

## Publication

This repo contains code for reproducing key results in [Image driven machine learning based microstructure recognition and quantification on small datasets](#).

Our previous work: [An image-driven machine learning approach to kinetic modeling of a discontinuous precipitation reaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.05496).
